\section*{}
The project's conclusions should list the things which have been learnt as a result of the work you have done. For example, "The use of overloading in C++ provides a very elegant mechanism for transparent parallelisation of sequential programs". Avoid tedious personal reflections like "I learned a lot about C++ programming..." It is common to finish the report by listing ways in which the project can be taken further. This might, for example, be a plan for doing the project better if you had a chance to do it again, turning the project deliverables into a more polished end product.
