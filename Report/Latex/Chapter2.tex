\section*{Carpooling}

\section{Definition and general principle}
\justify
Carpooling (also car-sharing, ride-sharing and lift-sharing) is that the sharing of car journeys in order to use the full capacity of a car, and full fill the need of others instead of to have to drive to a location themselves.\\

By using the full capacity of a vehicle, carpooling reduces each person's travel costs 
such as: fuel costs, tolls, and also the stress of driving. Carpooling is a environmentally 
friendly and better way to travel by sharing one vehicle reduces pollution, carbon emissions, reduce traffic on the roads, and also reduce the need of parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during times of high pollution or high fuel prices. Car sharing is a great way to  fritter away the total spaciousness of a car, which might otherwise remain unused if it were just the one person travelling in the car.\\

In 2009, carpooling represented 43.5\% of all trips within the U.S and 10\% of commute trips. The bulk of carpool commutes (over 60\%) are "fam-pools" with members of the family.\\

Carpooling or ride sharing is more popular among the folks who work in same place or nearby places, and who board city area. Ride sharing is significantly correlated with transport operating costs, including fuel prices and commute length, and with measures of social capital, like time spent with others, time spent eating and drinking . However, carpooling is less likely among people those spend longer at work, elderly people, and homeowners.\\

Ride sharing usually means to divide the travel expenses equally between all the occupants of the vehicle (driver or passenger). Vehicle owner doesn't want to earn money, but to cut down their fuel bills with the occupants of vehicle. The expenses divide include the fuel and tolls taxes. But if we include in the calculation the depreciation of the vehicle purchase and maintenance, insurance and taxes paid by the vehicle owner, we get a price around 20RS/km. Multiple platforms available that provide the facility of carpooling. Usually there's a fare founded by the car driver and accepted by passengers because they get an agreement before trip start.

\section{Carpooling Types}
\subsection{Regular}
The car is often perceived as an extension of the personal space, the driver, alone in his vehicle is in a closed space; he is free to do what he likes: listen to the radio, sing, call with headsets etc. Carpooling regularly is to share a dialogue, experiences, stories. In the United States an intermediate concept has developed between carpooling and the public transport line: the vanpool. These are minibuses chartered by an employer, a public authority or a private company and made available to a group of people who regularly make the same journey.

\subsection{Occasional}
This type of carpooling is mainly used for leisure or last minute departures. The linking is often done through websites or mobile applications, which can significantly reduce travel costs, but usually requires to carpool with one or more unknown.

\subsection{Eventual}
Participants in an event (music festival, sporting event, wedding, associative or institutional meeting ...) can organize to carpool to the venue of the event. this one-time carpool has a special feature: all participants travel to the same place on the same date.carpooling is also used for departures on holidays or weekends, savings on a trip being even larger than the trip is long. So carpooling becomes an alternative of affordable and accessible transportation.\\

There are also "cultural" carpooling platforms to visit a cultural site: castles, 
museums, exhibitions, artists' studios, religious places, festivals, etc.
\section{Advantages and disadvantages of carpooling applications}
\subsection{Advantages of carpooling}
\begin{itemize}
\item The advantage of carpooling is cost saving. A ride may be twice as cheap than traveling in own vehicle or in a private cab.
\item The car isn't a gas cost only. There are some cost items for the upkeep, repair, parts replacement in your vehicle. If you reduce the usage of car utilization, you reduce these costs.
\item A fewer number of cars on the road can reduce the emission of carbon dioxide and make the air cleaner. 
\item Saving time. Fewer cars - fewer traffic jams. that is to say, it is possible to reach at destination faster and solve the issue to find a parking place.
\item Meeting new people. Traveling together allows you to find out good friends. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Disadvantages of carpooling}
\begin{itemize}
\item Indecent riders. Some people can attemp to discount the price or even ask the driver to pickup or to go to the place that's not on the scheduled route. And it is important to point out such riders at the very beginning of trip.  
\item Indecent drivers. Unfortunately, some drivers can play an unfair game similarly as an example, drivers who overload the car and arouse a high price. 
\item In some cases, a driver have to pick up the each passenger separately. It increases the time of traveling.
\item Passengers may be not satisfied with the driving. In turn, the drivers are often annoyed with an excessive volubility of companions, their untidiness or lack of manners.
